# Chain Workspace Application - Project Brief

## Vision
Create a lightweight, intuitive workspace application that enables users to build and manage document processing chains with AI agents. The application serves as a visual canvas where users can connect documents to AI agents, creating powerful automated workflows for content analysis, transformation, and generation.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Visual Chain Building**: Drag-and-drop interface for connecting documents and AI agents
- **Event-Sourced State**: Complete undo/redo capability with manual versioning
- **AI-Powered Processing**: Integration with LLM services for intelligent document processing
- **Rapid Iteration**: Single-process architecture optimized for quick development cycles

## Target Users
- Content creators and editors
- Knowledge workers handling document workflows
- Developers prototyping AI-powered document processing
- Teams collaborating on document analysis and transformation

## Key Features
1. **Canvas Workspace**: SVG-based visual interface for building processing chains
2. **Document Management**: Rich text editing with version control
3. **Agent Configuration**: Custom AI agents with configurable prompts and tools
4. **Real-time Execution**: Stream processing results with visual feedback
5. **Event History**: Complete audit trail of all changes and operations

## Technical Philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Start with single-process architecture, scale horizontally later
- **Type Safety**: Schema-driven development with runtime validation
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage across all layers
- **Container-Ready**: Docker-first development and deployment
- **Memory Bank**: Long-term knowledge preservation through structured documentation

## Success Metrics
- Time to create first working chain < 5 minutes
- Document processing latency < 2 seconds
- System reliability > 99.9% uptime
- Developer productivity: Feature delivery in days, not weeks

## Project Constraints
- Single-process deployment for v1
- Web-based interface only
- PostgreSQL as single data store
- No real-time collaboration in v1

This project brief serves as the immutable foundation for all development decisions. Changes require explicit stakeholder approval.
