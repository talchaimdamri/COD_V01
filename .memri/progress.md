### 2025-08-05: Atomic Commit Workflow Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

**Task**: Implement atomic commit workflow eliminating two-commit pattern
**Git Commit**: [Current] - feat(agents): implement atomic commit workflow + memory bank updates
**Changes Applied**:

- ✅ **Updated commit-bot.md**: Reordered workflow to update Memory Bank BEFORE staging code changes
- ✅ **Enhanced commit message format**: Added `+ memory bank updates` suffix pattern for all commit types
- ✅ **Atomic staging approach**: Both code changes AND Memory Bank updates staged together in single operation
- ✅ **Quality gate reorder**: Memory Bank updates now required before commit (not after merge)
- ✅ **Workflow examples**: Added concrete examples of atomic commit messages with proper formatting
- ✅ **Documentation updates**: Enhanced commit-bot instructions with step-by-step atomic workflow

**Technical Implementation**:

- Modified commit workflow from post-merge to pre-commit Memory Bank updates
- Eliminated separate `docs(memory):` commits in favor of atomic operations
- Enhanced commit message convention with memory bank context inclusion
- Updated quality gates to enforce Memory Bank updates before staging

**Impact**:

- Eliminates temporal inconsistency between code changes and documentation
- Simplifies git history with single atomic commits per logical change
- Improves developer workflow by reducing commit overhead
- Maintains complete audit trail through atomic operations
- Enables easier rollbacks of complete logical changes including documentation

**Files Modified**: 1 agent file updated, 3 Memory Bank files updated
**Memory Bank Updates**: systemPatterns.md (atomic pattern), activeContext.md (decision), progress.md (this entry)
**Workflow Status**: First commit using new atomic pattern - this commit demonstrates the implementation
