# Active Context - Chain Workspace Application

## Current Development Phase
**Phase**: Project Initialization and Environment Setup
**Start Date**: 2025-08-05
**Target Completion**: 2025-08-12

## Active Decisions

### 2025-08-05: Project Structure and Sub-Agent Architecture
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive sub-agent architecture with Memory Bank system
**Context**: Setting up development environment with specialized agents for different concerns
**Impact**: Ensures clean separation of responsibilities and maintains long-term project knowledge

**Sub-Agents Created**:
- test-runner: TDD specialist, only agent allowed to modify test files
- schema-keeper: Guardian of all shared schemas and data contracts
- ui-developer: React/Tailwind UI implementation specialist
- backend-developer: Node.js/Fastify API development specialist  
- commit-bot: Git automation and Memory Bank maintenance

**Memory Bank Structure**:
- projectbrief.md: Immutable project foundation (read-only after creation)
- productContext.md: Business requirements and user stories
- systemPatterns.md: Architecture patterns and best practices
- techContext.md: Technology decisions and tool rationale
- activeContext.md: Current development decisions (this file)
- progress.md: Development progress tracking

### Current Sprint Goals
1. **Environment Setup**: Complete development environment configuration
2. **Core Structure**: Establish project directory structure and build tools
3. **Foundation Components**: Create basic schemas, database setup, and initial API structure
4. **Testing Framework**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy across all layers

## Active Technical Decisions

### Schema-First Development Approach
**Status**: In Progress
**Decision**: All data structures defined through Zod schemas before implementation
**Rationale**: Ensures type safety and consistency between frontend/backend
**Next Steps**: Create initial event, document, and agent schemas

### Event Sourcing for State Management
**Status**: Planned
**Decision**: Implement event sourcing for all application state changes
**Rationale**: Provides complete audit trail and enables undo/redo functionality
**Implementation Plan**: 
1. Define core event types (ADD_NODE, MOVE_NODE, etc.)
2. Implement event store with PostgreSQL
3. Create state reducer functions
4. Add undo/redo stack management

### Single-Process Architecture
**Status**: Confirmed
**Decision**: Start with single-process deployment, design for horizontal scaling
**Rationale**: Faster initial development, easier debugging, can scale later
**Future Migration Path**: Redis for shared state, multiple API instances

## Current Blockers
*None identified at this time*

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete package.json with all required dependencies
2. Set up Docker Compose for local development environment  
3. Create initial Prisma schema for database structure
4. Configure build tools (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)
5. Implement first test with test-runner agent

## Team Communication
**Primary Communication**: Claude Code sub-agent system
**Documentation Updates**: Commit-bot maintains Memory Bank after each significant change
**Decision Approval**: All architectural decisions documented in this file

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk**: Well-defined requirements and proven technology stack
**Medium Risk**: Complexity of event sourcing implementation
**High Risk**: None identified

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Start with simple event sourcing implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage from day one
- Regular architecture reviews through Memory Bank updates

### 2025-08-05: Initial Project Setup Complete
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Decision**: Successfully established complete development environment
**Outcome**: 
- All 38 setup files committed to git (commit: 2055b48)
- Sub-agent architecture fully operational
- Memory Bank system initialized and tracking decisions
- Development tools configured and ready for feature development
- Database schema deployed and tested
- Ready to begin TDD workflow with specialized agents

### 2025-08-05: Task Master AI Integration Decision
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Decision**: Integrate Task Master AI for systematic TDD workflow management
**Context**: Need structured approach to track 15 development tasks with comprehensive test-first methodology
**Implementation**:
- Parsed PRD document to generate 15 structured tasks with dependencies
- Established task-based commit format for traceability
- Created 38 TDD subtasks across 6 high-priority features
- Configured MCP integration for seamless Claude Code workflow
- Updated all task descriptions to follow test-runner → implementation → commit-bot pattern

**Impact**: 
- Complete TDD workflow now systematically tracked and managed
- Each task references specific test IDs from comprehensive test plan
- Sub-agent coordination improved with task-specific assignments
- Git commits now traceable to specific tasks for better project history
- Ready to begin Task 3 (Core Zod Schemas) with 9 TDD subtasks

**Next Phase**: Begin TDD implementation starting with Task 3 schema definitions

### 2025-08-05: Agent Quality Enhancement Decision
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Decision**: Enhance agent capabilities with comprehensive standards and configuration management
**Context**: Need systematic approach for maintaining agent quality and handling configuration updates
**Implementation**:
- **New Agent**: Created agent-updater.md for systematic agent configuration management
- **Enhanced Agent**: Updated test-runner.md with comprehensive testing standards:
  • File size limits (≤200 LOC) and separation of concerns (happy/error/edge cases)
  • Centralized fixtures under tests/fixtures/ with import reuse patterns
  • Parameterized testing with test.each() for input variations
  • Smart assertions guidance (toMatchObject vs toEqual usage)
  • Type checking requirements with z.infer<> validations
  • PRD traceability linking for complete coverage verification
  • Enhanced coverage thresholds (≥90% business logic, ≥80% overall)
  • Lint discipline and commit quality standards

**Impact**:
- Agent configuration changes now systematically managed with proper approval workflow
- Test quality standards enforced at architectural level through sub-agent instructions
- TDD workflow enhanced with comprehensive quality gates and traceability
- Memory Bank patterns updated to include agent configuration management
- Development process now includes explicit test file organization and quality requirements

**Next Actions**: Apply enhanced testing standards to upcoming Task 3 schema validation tests
