- ui-developer: React/Tailwind UI implementation specialist
- backend-developer: Node.js/Fastify API development specialist
- commit-bot: Git automation and Memory Bank maintenance

**Memory Bank Structure**:

- projectbrief.md: Immutable project foundation (read-only after creation)
- productContext.md: Business requirements and user stories
- systemPatterns.md: Architecture patterns and best practices
- techContext.md: Technology decisions and tool rationale
- activeContext.md: Current development decisions (this file)
- progress.md: Development progress tracking

### Current Sprint Goals

1. **Environment Setup**: Complete development environment configuration
2. **Core Structure**: Establish project directory structure and build tools
3. **Foundation Components**: Create basic schemas, database setup, and initial API structure
4. **Testing Framework**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy across all layers

## Active Technical Decisions

### Schema-First Development Approach

**Status**: In Progress
**Decision**: All data structures defined through Zod schemas before implementation
**Rationale**: Ensures type safety and consistency between frontend/backend
**Next Steps**: Create initial event, document, and agent schemas

### Event Sourcing for State Management

**Status**: Planned
**Decision**: Implement event sourcing for all application state changes

1. Define core event types (ADD_NODE, MOVE_NODE, etc.)
2. Implement event store with PostgreSQL
3. Create state reducer functions
4. Add undo/redo stack management

### Single-Process Architecture

**Status**: Confirmed
**Decision**: Start with single-process deployment, design for horizontal scaling
