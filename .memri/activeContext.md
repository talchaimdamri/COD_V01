# Active Development Context

## Current State: Task 9 Inspector Panel Development (August 10, 2025)

### Recently Completed: Task 8 - Left Sidebar Object Library âœ…

**Major Achievement**: Task 8 has been fully implemented and integrated into the Chain Workspace application. This represents a significant milestone in the application's development.

### Currently Active: Task 9 - Right Inspector Panel for Agent Configuration ðŸš€

**Major Progress**: Task 9 is actively in development with 2/6 subtasks completed and significant technical breakthroughs achieved in React Hook Form integration and validation timing.

#### Task 9 Current Implementation Status

**âœ… Completed Components**:
- **Inspector Panel Base Component**: Smooth slide-in/slide-out animations with backdrop
- **Agent Config Form Component**: React Hook Form + Zod validation integration (365+ lines)
- **Form Validation System**: Major breakthrough in timing issues - 4/5 tests passing
- **Animation System**: CSS transition-based slide animations with proper state management

**ðŸš§ In Progress Components**:
- **Agent Property Display Interface**: Form controls for name, prompt, description editing
- **Model Selection Dropdown**: AI model selection (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) with validation
- **Tools Configuration Interface**: Checklist for available tools and capabilities
- **Auto-Generate Prompt Feature**: AI-powered prompt generation with responsive design

**Integration Achievements**:
- **Form State Management**: Proper `data-valid`, `data-dirty`, `data-validating` attributes
- **Validation Timing**: Solved complex React Hook Form timing with `onSubmit` + `reValidateMode`
- **Component Integration**: InspectorPanel + AgentConfigForm seamless data flow
- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA labels, focus management, screen reader support

#### Technical Decisions Made (Task 9)

1. **React Hook Form Selection**: Chosen over Formik for superior TypeScript support and performance
2. **Form Validation Strategy**: `onSubmit` mode with `reValidateMode: 'onChange'` for optimal UX timing
3. **Animation Approach**: CSS transitions over Framer Motion for simpler, performance-focused animations
4. **Schema Integration**: Extended existing Zod validation system for form field validation
5. **Component Architecture**: Props-based configuration with event-driven form state communication

#### Previous Technical Decisions (Task 8)

1. **Virtualization Strategy**: Adopted @tanstack/react-virtual for superior performance with large datasets (1000+ items)
2. **Drag-and-Drop Approach**: Used native HTML5 APIs for better performance and accessibility
3. **State Management**: Integrated with existing event sourcing system for consistency
4. **Schema Validation**: Extended Zod schema system for type safety
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented viewport culling and frame monitoring

#### Current System Capabilities

**Inspector Panel Functionality** (New in Task 9):
- Context-sensitive panel that slides in from right when AgentNode selected
- Smooth slide-in/slide-out animations with backdrop overlay
- Agent configuration form with React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Real-time form validation with proper timing (4/5 tests passing)
- Accessibility features with ARIA labels and focus management
- Responsive design with click-outside-to-close functionality

**Form Management System** (New in Task 9):
- Comprehensive agent property editing (name, prompt, model, tools)
- Real-time validation feedback with debounced input handling
- Form state tracking with visual indicators (`data-valid`, `data-dirty`)
- Zod schema validation for runtime type safety
- Integration with existing event sourcing for state persistence

**Sidebar Functionality** (Task 8):
- Collapsible interface with resize handles (200px-600px constraints)
- Virtualized rendering for large datasets
- Advanced search and filtering
- Rich metadata display with thumbnails and badges
- Drag-and-drop to canvas with visual feedback

**Canvas Integration**:
- Accept dropped items from sidebar
- Create appropriate node types based on dropped data
- Agent node selection triggers inspector panel opening
- Performance optimization during sidebar interactions
- Event sourcing integration for undo/redo capabilities

**API Integration**:
- RESTful endpoints for sidebar data management
- CRUD operations for chains, documents, and agents
- Event sourcing for state persistence
- Schema validation for data integrity

#### Development Quality

**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive TDD approach with:
- Unit tests for all sidebar components
- Performance tests for virtualization
- Integration tests for Canvas drag-and-drop
- Edge case and error handling tests

**Code Quality**: 
- TypeScript throughout with strict typing
- Zod schema validation
- Consistent architecture patterns
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Immediate Next Priorities

With Task 9.1 and 9.2 substantially complete, immediate development focus is:

1. **Task 9.3**: Agent Property Display and Editing Interface - Implement form controls for agent name, prompt textarea, and description editing with auto-save functionality
2. **Task 9.4**: Model Selection Dropdown Component - Create dropdown for AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) with search/filter and compatibility validation
3. **Task 9.5**: Tools Configuration Interface - Build tools selection checklist with permissions and compatibility validation
4. **Task 9.6**: Auto-Generate Prompt Feature - Implement AI-powered prompt generation and responsive design optimization

**Medium-term priorities after Task 9 completion**:
5. **Enhanced Chain Creation Workflows**: Leverage completed sidebar + inspector for improved chain building
6. **Advanced AI Agent Integration**: Utilize completed agent management system
7. **Multi-user Collaboration**: Implement real-time collaboration features
8. **Performance Refinements**: Monitor and optimize based on usage patterns

### System Architecture State

**Current Architecture Strengths**:
- Event-sourced state management with undo/redo
- Schema-driven development with type safety
- Performance-optimized rendering systems
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Modular component architecture

**Technical Debt Assessment**: Minimal technical debt introduced. Implementation follows established patterns and maintains consistency with existing architecture.
