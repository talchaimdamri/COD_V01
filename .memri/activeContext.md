# Active Context - Chain Workspace Application

## Current Development Phase
**Phase**: Project Initialization and Environment Setup
**Start Date**: 2025-08-05
**Target Completion**: 2025-08-12

## Active Decisions

### 2025-08-05: Project Structure and Sub-Agent Architecture
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive sub-agent architecture with Memory Bank system
**Context**: Setting up development environment with specialized agents for different concerns
**Impact**: Ensures clean separation of responsibilities and maintains long-term project knowledge

**Sub-Agents Created**:
- test-runner: TDD specialist, only agent allowed to modify test files
- schema-keeper: Guardian of all shared schemas and data contracts
- ui-developer: React/Tailwind UI implementation specialist
- backend-developer: Node.js/Fastify API development specialist  
- commit-bot: Git automation and Memory Bank maintenance

**Memory Bank Structure**:
- projectbrief.md: Immutable project foundation (read-only after creation)
- productContext.md: Business requirements and user stories
- systemPatterns.md: Architecture patterns and best practices
- techContext.md: Technology decisions and tool rationale
- activeContext.md: Current development decisions (this file)
- progress.md: Development progress tracking

### Current Sprint Goals
1. **Environment Setup**: Complete development environment configuration
2. **Core Structure**: Establish project directory structure and build tools
3. **Foundation Components**: Create basic schemas, database setup, and initial API structure
4. **Testing Framework**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy across all layers

## Active Technical Decisions

### Schema-First Development Approach
**Status**: In Progress
**Decision**: All data structures defined through Zod schemas before implementation
**Rationale**: Ensures type safety and consistency between frontend/backend
**Next Steps**: Create initial event, document, and agent schemas

### Event Sourcing for State Management
**Status**: Planned
**Decision**: Implement event sourcing for all application state changes
**Rationale**: Provides complete audit trail and enables undo/redo functionality
**Implementation Plan**: 
1. Define core event types (ADD_NODE, MOVE_NODE, etc.)
2. Implement event store with PostgreSQL
3. Create state reducer functions
4. Add undo/redo stack management

### Single-Process Architecture
**Status**: Confirmed
**Decision**: Start with single-process deployment, design for horizontal scaling
**Rationale**: Faster initial development, easier debugging, can scale later
**Future Migration Path**: Redis for shared state, multiple API instances

## Current Blockers
*None identified at this time*

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete package.json with all required dependencies
2. Set up Docker Compose for local development environment  
3. Create initial Prisma schema for database structure
4. Configure build tools (Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)
5. Implement first test with test-runner agent

## Team Communication
**Primary Communication**: Claude Code sub-agent system
**Documentation Updates**: Commit-bot maintains Memory Bank after each significant change
**Decision Approval**: All architectural decisions documented in this file

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk**: Well-defined requirements and proven technology stack
**Medium Risk**: Complexity of event sourcing implementation
**High Risk**: None identified

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Start with simple event sourcing implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage from day one
- Regular architecture reviews through Memory Bank updates
