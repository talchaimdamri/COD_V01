		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Right Inspector Panel for Agent Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the inspector panel implementation into: base component with animations, form integration with validation, property editing interface, model selection dropdown, tools configuration checklist, and auto-generate prompt with responsive design. Focus on React Hook Form + Zod integration and real-time validation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple React patterns (forms, validation, animations), but well-structured with 6 existing subtasks. Most subtasks are complete (4/6 done), indicating good progress and clear breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Create Agent Editor Popup with Model Selection",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: popup overlay component with modal behavior, agent configuration form with validation, model selection interface, auto-generate prompt functionality, and agent templates/prompt library. Include testing interface and custom model parameters support.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity with form management, API integration, and popup behavior. Similar to Task 9 but as a popup rather than panel. Needs breakdown into manageable components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Manual Agent Execution with Streaming Output",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Following TDD methodology, break into: comprehensive test creation (unit and integration), LLM API integration with streaming, real-time UI component for output display, execution result storage system, and rate limiting/queuing implementation. Use specialized sub-agents for each domain.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity involving LLM API integration, real-time streaming, database operations, and concurrent execution handling. Already has 5 well-defined subtasks following TDD approach with proper sub-agent delegation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Build Chain State Management and Canvas Persistence",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: state store setup (Redux Toolkit/Zustand), auto-save implementation with debouncing, canvas state serialization, persistence API integration, state rehydration logic, and conflict resolution for concurrent modifications.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to state management patterns, persistence layer, and conflict resolution. Requires careful architecture for auto-save, rehydration, and concurrent access handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Node Context Menus and Interaction System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: long-press detection system, context menu component with positioning, double-click handlers, keyboard shortcuts implementation, multi-selection system (Ctrl+click and rectangle), node grouping functionality, and bulk operations interface.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving multiple interaction patterns (touch, mouse, keyboard), cross-platform compatibility, and complex selection logic. Each interaction type has different implementation challenges and edge cases."
