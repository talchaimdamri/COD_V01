			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the inspector panel implementation into: panel UI component with slide animation, form validation integration with React Hook Form and Zod, agent property display and editing, model selection dropdown, tools configuration interface, and responsive design optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Complex UI component requiring form management, validation, responsive design, and integration with multiple systems (React Hook Form, Zod schemas, agent data). Moderate complexity due to well-established patterns but needs careful attention to UX details like animations and real-time validation."
