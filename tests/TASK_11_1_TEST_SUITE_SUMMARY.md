- `mockVersionDiffs`: Complex diff scenarios
- Version history selectors and utilities
- Performance measurement utilities
- Event generation helpers

## Test Architecture

### Following TDD Principles
1. **Fail First**: All tests are designed to fail until implementation
2. **Test-Driven Commits**: Each test references specific PRD requirements  
3. **Traceability**: Test IDs link to Task Master requirements

### Test Quality Standards
- **File Organization**: Separate files for happy path, errors, performance
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: UI, API, performance, error scenarios
- **Realistic Data**: Large datasets, edge cases, error conditions
- **Performance Focused**: Specific thresholds and optimization testing

## Key Components to Implement

Based on these tests, the following components need to be implemented:

### 1. VersionHistoryPanel Component
- Timeline UI showing versions with timestamps
- Metadata display (author, word count, character count)
- Selection and comparison functionality
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets

### 2. VersionDiff Component  
- Side-by-side diff viewer
- Unified diff view toggle
- Addition/deletion highlighting
- HTML-aware diff calculations

### 3. VersionControls Component
- Undo/redo toolbar integration
- Button state management
- Keyboard shortcut support
- Performance optimization

### 4. Enhanced Event Sourcing
- Version snapshot creation/restoration
- Event buffering for performance
- Large dataset handling
- Error recovery mechanisms

### 5. Version Management API
- Complete CRUD operations for versions
- Diff calculation endpoints
- Event sourcing integration
- Error handling and validation

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all version history tests
npm test -- --match="version|undo|redo"

# Run specific test suites
npm test tests/e2e/document-version-history.spec.ts
npm test tests/unit/document-undo-redo.test.ts  
npm test tests/unit/document-event-sourcing.test.ts
npm test tests/integration/document-version-api.test.ts
npm test tests/unit/document-version-performance.test.ts

# Run performance tests specifically
npm test -- --match="PERF"
```

## Test Success Criteria

All tests should **PASS** once the following are implemented:

1. ✅ Version History UI components render correctly
2. ✅ Undo/Redo operations work with proper state management
3. ✅ Event sourcing handles version snapshots and restoration
4. ✅ API endpoints respond correctly with proper validation
5. ✅ Performance meets specified thresholds
6. ✅ Error handling gracefully manages edge cases

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Phase**: Begin implementing components to make tests pass
2. **Iterative Development**: Use tests to guide implementation decisions
3. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on meeting performance thresholds
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error recovery mechanisms
5. **Integration Testing**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the Document Version History and Undo/Redo system will be robust, performant, and user-friendly when implemented following TDD principles.
